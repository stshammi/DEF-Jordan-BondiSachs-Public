# DEF_Jordan_BondiSachs_Public

Damour-Esposito-Farese (DEF) scalar-tensor theory in Bondi-Sachs framework.

The Mathematica notebook DEF_Jordan_Public.nb contains the calculation of asymptotically flat solutions and asymptotic symmetries in Bondi-Sachs framework of DEF scalar-tensor theory. The calculations are applicable to DEF theory in the Jordan frame. If you make use of this notebook, please cite the accompanying paper:
