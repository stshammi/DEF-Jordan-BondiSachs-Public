Damour-Esposito-Farese scalar-tensor theory in Bondi-Sachs framework

This notebook contains the calculation of asymptotically flat solutions and asymptotic symmetries in Bondi-Sachs framework of the Damour-Esposito-Farese (DEF) scalar-tensor theory. The calculations are applicable to DEF theory in Jordan frame. If you make use of this notebook, please cite the accompanying paper using following BibTex format:
